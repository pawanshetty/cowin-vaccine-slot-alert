/**
 * <p>Given a list of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns the verification
 *             status and (for domain identities) the verification token for each identity.</p>
 *         <p>The verification status of an email address is "Pending" until the email address owner
 *             clicks the link within the verification email that Amazon SES sent to that address. If the
 *             email address owner clicks the link within 24 hours, the verification status of the
 *             email address changes to "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the
 *             verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to verify the
 *             email address, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.</p>
 *         <p>For domain identities, the domain's verification status is "Pending" as Amazon SES searches
 *             for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of the domain. When Amazon SES detects the
 *             record, the domain's verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to
 *             detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's verification status changes to "Failed."
 *             In that case, if you still want to verify the domain, you must restart the verification
 *             process from the beginning.</p>
 *         <p>This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get verification
 *             attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.</p>
